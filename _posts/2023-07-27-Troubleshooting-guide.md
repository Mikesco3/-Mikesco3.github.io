# Why, What for...
I often run into quick guides on how to troubleshoot a computer, so I thought I'd put together my own version of a simple list I generally follow when trying to identify a problem. 
Obviously this is a very general simplified version, and once with enough experience troubleshooting something you start to develop an instinct about where to zoom in and narrow the search process.  <br>
You don't necessarily need to follow the order or the whole guide, usually you'll get hints that will lead to the solution along the way. <br>

# Before Anything:
## If possible: **CREATE A BACKUP FIRST**,
1. **Try avoid doing something you cannot undo...** <br>
Take notes (connections, settings, passwords), 
Take Pictures... 

2. **Consider all Data Essential**... <br> 
Especially if you're unfamiliar with the information you're handling...  <br>
 If you ever have to decide only between saving Data or Hardware: <br>
 <strong>Hardware shouldn't stand a chance!!!</strong> <br><br>
 I've seen too many techs delete or loose critical data on their way to fixing the problem. 
> _**That would be like a Doctor not knowing whether to kill the Cancer or the patient...**_

# Begin:

1. Check Power: (in all of it's variants) <br>
(is the thing plugged in?, battery voltage, etc.) <br>
Reboot... <br>

2. Check Connections 
 (Cables plugged in properly?, all the way in?, Cards seated properly?, corroded connectors?)

3. Test Hardware:
  **3.1.** Unplug non-essential cards and peripherals. <br>
  _(You might want to take some notes and/or pictures if the connections are complex)_ <br>
  **3.2.** Test RAM (memtest) <br>
  **3.3.** check hard drive (surface scan) <br>
   Last chance to **GRAB A BACKUP!**  <br>
_Or you can also clone the data onto another drive and work on a copy of the original._  <br>
_**(Beyond this point, there be dragons!)**_  <br> 
4. Once that checks out move to software:  <br>
  **4.1.** Start in safe-mode <br>
  **4.2.** Virus check <br>
  **4.3.** Updates, <br>
  **4.4.** Check Logs. <br>

> All of that being said, there is no substitute for experience.
