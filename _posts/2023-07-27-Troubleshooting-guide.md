# Why, What for...
I often run into quick guides on how to troubleshoot a computer, so I thought I'd put together my own version of a simple list I generally follow when trying to identify a problem. 
Obviously this is a very general simplified version, and once with enough experience troubleshooting something you start to develop an instinct about where to zoom in and narrow the search process.  <br>
You don't necessarily need to follow the order or the whole guide, usually you'll get hints that will lead to the solution along the way.

# Before Anything:
## Try avoid doing something you cannot undo...
So, if possible: 
### **CREATE A BACKUP FIRST**.

## If you're unfamiliar with the Data you're handling, consider all of it essential... 

## If you ever have to decide between saving Data or the Hardware: Usually the Hardware shouldn't stand a chance!!!
_I've seen too many techs delete critical data on their way to fixing the problem._ <br>
> _**That would be like a Doctor not knowing whether to kill the Cancer or the patient...**_

# Begin Troubleshooting:

## 1. Check Power: (in all of it's variants)
(is the thing plugged in?, reboot, battery voltage, etc.)

## 2. Check Connections 
 (Cables plugged in properly?, all the way in?, Cards seated properly?, corroded connectors?)

## 3. Test Hardware:
###   3.1. Unplug non-essential cards and peripherals.
  _(You might want to take some notes and/or pictures if the connections are complex)_
###   3.2. Test RAM (memtest) 
###   3.3. check hard drive (surface scan)

## Last chance to **GRAB A BACKUP!** 
Or you can also clone the data onto another drive and do the work on the copy of the original.

_(Beyond this point, there be dragons!)_
 
## 4. Once that checks out move to software:
###   4.1. Start in safe-mode
###   4.2. Virus check
###   4.3. Updates,
###   4.4. Logs.

All of that being said, there is no substitute for experience.
