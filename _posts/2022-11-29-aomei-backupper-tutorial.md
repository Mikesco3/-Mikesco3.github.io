# Why, What for...
A full image backup captures the whole filesystem, so that in the event of a hard drive failure, or total loss of the computer, the system can be restored entirely as it was at the time of the backup, even if restoring onto an entirely different computer. <br>

We are going to focus on Aomei Backupper Free, as it is fairly generous in it's free version and the backups are pretty maleable. <br>
*See the bottom on this article for a [list](#software) of other backup software options.*
