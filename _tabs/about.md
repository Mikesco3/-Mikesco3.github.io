## Mikesco3 - Michael Schmitz
I am a self-taught IT business owner and entrepreneur. I try to focus on the human aspect and business side of IT solutions. My expertise lies in bridging the gap between people's goals and technology, providing a range of services from strategy consulting to seamless deployment. I primarily serve small businesses in the Cedar Rapids, IA area. <br>
 <br> 

Sometimes, I function as the main IT person, providing ongoing support and maintenance to keep systems running smoothly. On other occasions, I'm a business strategy consultant, helping clients align their technology investments with their overall objectives. Additionally, I act as a supplemental IT specialist, offering my expertise to assist main IT teams when they encounter challenging issues. <br> 
 <br> 
My approach is to try to first understand the human element and then the business needs and from there develop a holistic technology solution. By combining my expertise in IT and my focus on the human and business aspects, I am dedicated to empowering businesses in the Cedar Rapids IA Area to harness the full potential of technology for their growth and success.<br>
